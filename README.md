// TODO(user): Add simple overview of use/purpose

## Description
// TODO(user): An in-depth paragraph about your project and overview of use

## Features

This Odoo Operator provides the following key features:

*   **Odoo Instance Management**: Deploy and manage Odoo StatefulSets, including PostgreSQL instances (managed or external) and associated services and ingresses.
*   **Resource Management**: Configure CPU and memory resource requests and limits for Odoo, PostgreSQL, and initialization/upgrade containers.
*   **Persistent Storage**: Automatic provisioning of Persistent Volume Claims (PVCs) for Odoo data, logs, and addons, with configurable sizes and access modes.
*   **Backup and Restore**: Implement backup (`OdooBackup`) and restore (`OdooRestore`) operations, supporting various storage locations (e.g., PVC-based backups).
*   **Automatic Module Upgrades**: Automatically trigger Odoo module upgrades (e.g., `-u all` or specific modules) when the Odoo version in the Custom Resource (CR) is updated.
*   **Odoo Enterprise Support**: Seamless integration for Odoo Enterprise Edition, including automatic cloning of the Enterprise Git repository into the addons volume using SSH keys.
*   **Custom Module Integration**: Support for installing a custom list of Odoo modules (`-i` command) during initialization and updates. This includes the ability to clone additional Git repositories containing custom or community addons into dedicated subdirectories within the addons volume.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- go version v1.24.6+
- docker version 17.03+.
- kubectl version v1.11.3+.
- Access to a Kubernetes v1.11.3+ cluster.

### To Deploy on the cluster
**Build and push your image to the location specified by `IMG`:**

```sh
make docker-build docker-push IMG=<some-registry>/operator:tag
```

**NOTE:** This image ought to be published in the personal registry you specified.
And it is required to have access to pull the image from the working environment.
Make sure you have the proper permission to the registry if the above commands don’t work.

**Install the CRDs into the cluster:**

```sh
make install
```

**Deploy the Manager to the cluster with the image specified by `IMG`:**

```sh
make deploy IMG=<some-registry>/operator:tag
```

> **NOTE**: If you encounter RBAC errors, you may need to grant yourself cluster-admin
privileges or be logged in as admin.

**Create instances of your solution**
You can apply the samples (examples) from the config/sample:

```sh
kubectl apply -k config/samples/
```

>**NOTE**: Ensure that the samples has default values to test it out.

### To Uninstall
**Delete the instances (CRs) from the cluster:**

```sh
kubectl delete -k config/samples/
```

**Delete the APIs(CRDs) from the cluster:**

```sh
make uninstall
```

**UnDeploy the controller from the cluster:**

```sh
make undeploy
```

## Project Distribution

Following the options to release and provide this solution to the users.

### By providing a bundle with all YAML files

1. Build the installer for the image built and published in the registry:

```sh
make build-installer IMG=<some-registry>/operator:tag
```

**NOTE:** The makefile target mentioned above generates an 'install.yaml'
file in the dist directory. This file contains all the resources built
with Kustomize, which are necessary to install this project without its
dependencies.

2. Using the installer

Users can just run 'kubectl apply -f <URL for YAML BUNDLE>' to install
the project, i.e.:

```sh
kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/<org>/operator/<tag or branch>/dist/install.yaml
```

### By providing a Helm Chart

1. Build the chart using the optional helm plugin

```sh
kubebuilder edit --plugins=helm/v2-alpha
```

2. See that a chart was generated under 'dist/chart', and users
can obtain this solution from there.

**NOTE:** If you change the project, you need to update the Helm Chart
using the same command above to sync the latest changes. Furthermore,
if you create webhooks, you need to use the above command with
the '--force' flag and manually ensure that any custom configuration
previously added to 'dist/chart/values.yaml' or 'dist/chart/manager/manager.yaml'
is manually re-applied afterwards.
